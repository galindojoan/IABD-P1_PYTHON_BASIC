# IABD-P1_PYTHON_BASIC

## Games:
- Guess the number.
- Rock - Paper - Scissors.
- The hanged.

## Description:
Create a Python application that displays a menu allowing the user to choose to play one of the following different games:

  - Guess the Number: The user will have three attempts to guess a random number between 1 and 10. For each incorrect guess, the program will display whether the number is         higher or lower than the guessed number.
  
  - Rock - Paper - Scissors: The first player to reach 3 points wins.
  
  - The hanged:
      The program will start with a list of 30 words, each between 3 and 7 letters long, obtained from an external file.
      One of the 30 words will be randomly selected.
      The user will have number of letters in the word x 2 attempts to guess the word.
      The typical board will be displayed before each guess: R _ _ _ _
      
* In all the games, it is mandatory to ensure that the user inputs valid options. 
** In the Rock-Paper-Scissors and Hanged games, it is mandatory to use custom functions. 
*** The project must be uploaded to GIT.
